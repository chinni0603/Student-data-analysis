# Student-data-analysis
Designed and executed a comprehensive project involving the analysis of student data leveraging Microsoft Power BI. The project aimed to extract insights from complex datasets and enhance decision-making processes. In addition, I developed a website that seamlessly integrated the Power BI dashboards for easy access and navigation.

• Utilized Power BI to visualize and analyze student data, identifying trends and patterns in academic performance.
• Developed a responsive website connecting the Power BI dashboards to provide a user-friendly platform for accessing real-time data.
• Collaborated with a team of 4 members to streamline the project's development and successfully meet project milestones.
